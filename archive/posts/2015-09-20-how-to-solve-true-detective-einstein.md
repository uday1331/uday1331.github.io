If you participated in the True Detective event of FGS Science Carnival 2015 at FFC Grammar School, Mirpur Mathelo, you would have encountered a modified/localised version of the Einstein Puzzle. If you haven't attempted it before, I will highly recommend you to try it first and then see the solution below.


### The Puzzle: 
There are 5 houses in 5 different colours. In each house lives a person of a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of drink, drive a certain type of car, and keep a certain pet. Using the clues below can you determine who keeps the wolves?  

1. The Pakistani lives in a red house.
2. The Swede keeps dogs as pets.
3. The American drinks lassi.
4. The green house is on the immediate left of the white house.
5. The green house owner drinks coffee.
6. The person who drives a Toyota rears birds.
7. The owner of the yellow house drives a Suzuki.
8. The man living in the house right in the middle drinks milk.
9. The Brit lives in the first house.
10. The man who drives a Honda lives next door to the one who keeps cats.
11. The man who keeps horses lives next door to the man who drives a Suzuki.
12. The owner who drives a Bentley drinks chocolate.
13. The Indian drives a BMW.
14. The Brit lives next to the blue house.
15. The man who drives a Honda has a neighbour who drinks water.
